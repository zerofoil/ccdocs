# Importing and Using Templates

Templates are pre-built command configurations created by our awesome community, including staff and the owner! They're designed to be easily imported and set up directly from your dashboard, no bot coding knowledge required. Think of them as shortcuts to powerful commands.

## Importing a Template: A Step-by-Step Guide

Here's how to import and use a template in your custom commands:

1.  **Navigate to the Custom Commands Tab:** Open the dashboard and find the "Custom Commands" section.

2.  **Find the Templates Button:** Look for a yellow button, usually located in the middle, specifically for accessing templates.  It might be labeled "Templates" or have a related icon.

3.  **Browse and Choose a Template:**  Explore the available templates and find one that suits your needs.  Read the descriptions carefully to understand what each template does.

4.  **Select All Commands (If Applicable):** Some templates contain multiple commands.  If so, select *all* the commands that are part of the template.

5.  **Configure the Command (If Required):**  *Not all* templates need configuration. If a template requires it, carefully follow the instructions provided with the template to configure it properly. This might involve setting specific roles, channels, or other parameters.

6.  **Wait for Import:** The template commands will now be imported into your custom commands. This may take a few moments, depending on the complexity of the template.

7.  **Read the Usage Instructions:** **Crucially, read the usage instructions!** The template author will provide information on how to properly use the command, including any required arguments or special considerations. This is often displayed after importing.

8.  **Template Imported as Custom Command(s):** Once imported, the template will appear as a standard custom command in your custom commands list.

9.  **Customize as Needed:**  You have full control! You can edit the imported command at any time to further customize it to your specific requirements.
