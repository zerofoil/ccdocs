# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Why does the bot have such high cooldowns?

::: details Answer
Our bot is still growing! Unfortunately, we haven't reached a size where Discord can decrease our rate limits. To prevent penalties from Discord, we've had to implement cooldowns on certain functions and command executions. We appreciate your understanding!

## Are there built-in commands, or do I have to code them all myself?

::: details Answer
You'll primarily need to code your own commands. We only have a few basic commands like `!!purge` and `!!ban` pre-built. You can see a list of these by running `!!commands` in your server.

Other commands include retrieving a dashboard link or your total votes. Learn more in the [Bot Information Guide](../Guide/botInfo.md).
