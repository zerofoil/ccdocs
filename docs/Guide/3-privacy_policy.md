# Custom Command Bot Privacy Policy

This page provides detailed information about your rights, our rights, and other important information regarding your privacy when using Custom Command Bot.

# Our Rights & Responsibilities

*   **Age Restriction:** Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use our service.
*   **Prohibited Activities:** Self-botting or any misuse of our bot is strictly prohibited.
*   **Content Restrictions:** Our bot (including custom bots created with it) cannot be used to send, host, or facilitate the distribution of offensive, controversial, pirated, or NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content.
*   **Terms of Service Compliance:** You are required to adhere to the Discord Terms of Service and any applicable third-party Terms of Service.

Failure to comply with these rules may result in a ban from using the bot and, in severe cases (e.g., scam servers), a report to Discord.

# Your Rights

*   **Data Removal/Request:** You have the right to request access to or deletion of your data.

    *   **Server Owners:** You can delete data yourself by deleting all Custom Commands and Variables within your server's configuration.
    *   **Users:** You can leave the server using the bot, or contact us directly to request to opt-out and have your data removed.

*   **Reporting Misuse:** You have the right to report any server that you believe is misusing our bot.

# Data We Collect

We collect the following data to ensure the bot functions correctly and efficiently:

*   **Server ID:** Used to identify data and store functional data related to your server (e.g., command count).
*   **User's Command Code:** We store the code you create for your custom commands to enable the bot's functionality.
*   **Variables:** We store variables that you set within your commands. You can opt-out of this data collection by leaving the server using the bot.

**Important Note:** Unlike some other bots, we do *not* store any private data. We primarily store server IDs for functional purposes.

# Message Content Intent

With the new Discord Message Content Intent requirements, it's important to understand how we handle message data:

*   **No Message Logging:** We **do not** log or save any message content.
*   **Triggered Commands Only:** Custom commands are only executed when a user sends a message that matches a specific trigger defined in that command.  Not every message triggers a command, which helps protect your privacy.
*   **Cooldowns:** To prevent abuse and protect user privacy, commands can only process a message every 4 seconds if the command has been triggered.
*   **View Commands:** You can use the `!!view` command to see what commands are being used on a server.
*   **Opt-Out:** You can always **opt-out** of our bot by leaving the server. Your data will be deleted within 15 days, but can be expedited to approximately 1-2 days if you contact us.

# Data Retention

*   We perform regular backups (approximately every 10 days). Old backups are overwritten.


# Encryption

All data is stored and encrypted in our database. This ensures that the data is protected from unauthorized access, even in the event of a security breach. Accessing the database without our salted token is not possible.

# Contact Us

We recommend contacting us through our Discord server for the fastest response.
