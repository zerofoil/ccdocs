# Disable @everyone Mentions

This command disables the ability for users to mention everyone in the channel using the `@everyone` role.

## How to Use

Simply use the command:

```bash
$disableEveryoneMentions
```

**What this does:**

*   Prevents users from using `@everyone` to ping the entire server or channel.
*   Helps reduce unnecessary notifications and maintain a more focused environment.

**Example:**

If a user tries to type `@everyone` after this command is used, it will not send a notification to everyone.
