# Enable @everyone Mentions

This command allows you to enable the use of `@everyone` mentions in your Discord server (if disabled by default).  **Use with caution!** Enabling `@everyone` can be disruptive if not managed properly.

## How to Use

Simply run the `$enableEveryoneMentions` command.

```bash
$enableEveryoneMentions
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   Think carefully about whether enabling `@everyone` is the right choice for your community. Consider the potential for abuse and spam.
*   If you enable `@everyone`, ensure you have moderation tools and guidelines in place to prevent misuse.
*   Disabling `@everyone` is generally a good practice for larger servers to avoid mass notifications.  Only enable it if you have a specific reason and a plan to manage its use.
