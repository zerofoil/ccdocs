# $imageTextStrokeColor

Sets the outline (stroke) color of the text in your image.

## Description

The `$imageTextStrokeColor` function allows you to define the color of the outline or stroke that appears around the text you're adding to an image. This can help the text stand out and improve readability, especially when the text and background colors are similar.

## Usage

```bash
$imageTextStrokeColor[Color name]
```

**Parameters:**

*   `Color name`: The name of the color you want to use for the text stroke. This can be a standard CSS color name (e.g., `red`, `blue`, `green`, `white`, `black`) or a hexadecimal color code (e.g., `#FF0000` for red, `#0000FF` for blue).  

**Example:**

To set the text stroke color to blue, you would use:

```bash
$imageTextStrokeColor[blue]
```

To set the text stroke color to a specific shade of green using a hex code, you would use:

```bash
$imageTextStrokeColor[#00FF00]
```

**Tips:**

*   Experiment with different stroke colors to find the best contrast with your text and background.
