# Bot Tier

This command retrieves the current tier level of your bot. Think of it as a subscription level that unlocks more features and benefits.

The standard, free version of the bot operates at **Tier 0**.

## How to Use

Simply use the command:

```
$botTier
```

The command will then return the tier level of your bot.
