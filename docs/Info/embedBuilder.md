4.  Select the desired channel. In this example, we're using `#general`.  **Important:** Ensure the bot has permission to view and send messages, including embeds and images, in the selected channel. This usually requires the "View Channel," "Send Messages," "Embed Links," and "Attach Files" permissions.
