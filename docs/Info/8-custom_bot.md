# Setting Up Your Custom Bot

If you have Tier 3+ access, here's how to set it up. You only need to do this once.

## 1. Discord Developer Portal

Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). This is where you'll manage your bot appearance.

Click the button `New Application` to create your bot.

Here you can change the bot name, profile picture, banner and other important stuff. What we need to do here, is to make the bot private, and turn on all available intents.

Copy following settings and save the changes.

::: tip Private application cannot have a default authorization link
If this error shows when changing your bot to private app, head to `Installation` page and set it to `None`.
