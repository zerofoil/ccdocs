# Setting Up Your Custom Bot

This guide will walk you through setting up your own custom bot. This feature is available to users who have achieved Tier 3+ access, either by redeeming it or by winning it in our support server.

## One-Time Setup Steps

Follow these steps to create and connect your custom bot. You only need to do this once!

### 1. Access the Discord Developer Portal

Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). This is where you'll create and manage your bot.

### 2. Create a New Application

Click the "New Application" button.

### 9. Invite Your Bot to Your Server

### 10. All Done!

You're finished! Wait a few minutes for your bot to come online. :tada:

**Important:** Make sure the main CCommandBot remains in your server. Removing the main bot will prevent you from accessing the dashboard and managing your custom bot.
