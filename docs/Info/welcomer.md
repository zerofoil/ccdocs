2.  **Configure Member Join/Leave Settings:**

    Within the Welcomer tab, you'll find a section labeled `Member Join/Leave`.  This is where you customize the messages for when members join or leave your server.  Set your desired custom details in this section, such as the welcome message, member goodbye message, and image.

4.  **Choose Your Channel:**

    Select the channel you want the messages to be sent to. In this example, `#general` is selected. You can choose any channel that your bot can *see* and has the necessary permissions to *send messages*.

    **Important:** Ensure the bot has the "Embed Links" and "Attach Files" permissions in the selected channel.  This is crucial for the bot to be able to send rich embedded messages and images without any issues.
