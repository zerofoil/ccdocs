# Staff application
In this guide you will learn how to make a form using **discord modals**.

Here's how it's going to look like:

## 1. Button sending
Let's send a button users will use to open up the form.

The button will be `blurple`, have a label `Apply` and an id `staff-app`.
```php
!!exec $button[Apply;blurple;staff-app]
```

## 2. Button handling
Once we have our button ready, let's make a command to handle it.

#### Trigger
It will have a `button` type, and a trigger `staff-app` *(the ID we set in the previous step)*

#### Code
The button is meant to send a modal upon clicking, so let's use **$modal** to deploy a form with three options:
* Position
* Reason
* Pronouns

```php
$modal[
    {title=Staff application}
    {id=staff-app}
    
    {input=
        {name=Position}
        {ph=What position would you like to apply for?}
        {id=position}
        {type=short}
        {min=5}
        {max=100}
    }
    
    {input=
        {name=Reason}
        {ph=Why do you apply?}
        {id=reason}
        {type=long}
        {min=20}
    }
    
    {input=
        {name=Pronouns}
        {ph=What pronouns do you use?}
        {id=pronouns}
        {type=short}
        {required=no}
    }
]
```

## 3. Modal handling
As you may have noticed, after clicking the button modal appears, but submitting it doesn't do anything.
We'll now create a command to catch all the submitted forms.

#### Trigger
In order to detect submitted forms, we need to set the type to `Modal`, and trigger to `staff-app` *(Which is our modal ID)*
![Modal trigger](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/957286111250624552/1100142660448165960/image.png)

#### Code
Once we catch a submitted form, we need to do a few things:
1. Load user's answers
2. Send a report to a different channel
3. Confirm the submission with an interaction reply

```php

// Save answers to different variables
$let[position;$modalAnswer[1]]
$let[reason;$modalAnswer[reason]]
$let[pronouns;$modalAnswer[pronouns]]

// Send message to #staff-applications
$channelSendMessage[$channelID[staff-applications];
    
    {author:$usertag:$authorAvatar}
    {title:Staff application}
    {description:$mention has submitted the staff application}
    {field:Position:$position}
    {field:Reason:```$reason```}
    
    // Attach pronouns section only if provided
    $if[$get[pronouns]!=]
        {footer:Pronouns\: $pronouns} // : has been escaped using a backslash
    $endIf
    
]

// Send an ephemeral interaction reply
$interactionReply[Thank you for your submission;yes]
```
