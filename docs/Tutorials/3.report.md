# Report command
Here's a step-by-step instruction on how to create a simple report command.

## 1. Setting trigger
Users are meant to report using a word command `!report`, so let's set a corresponding trigger

![!report trigger](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/957286111250624552/1100494691721560116/image.png)

## 2. Getting user ID
Let's begin by loading the ID of provided user. For that we will use a combination of two functions:

* [$message](../Message/message.md) - to load user input
* [$findMember](../Member/findMember.md) - to get the id regardless of input format

and save them in a [$let](../Variables/let.md) variable.
```php
// $message[1] returns the first parameter
// $findMember[...;no] returns user id or undefined 
$let[reportedUser;$findMember[$message[1];no]]
```

## 3. Loading reason
Users should be able to describe what behavior they want to report, let's save the rest of parameters to a new variable.
```php
$let[reason;$message[2+]]
```

## 4. Send report
As we have all data stored and ready, we will procceed to send the report. For that we will use:

* [$channelID](../Channel/channelID) - to change channel name to ID
* [$channelSendMessage](../Message/channelSendMessage.md) - to send a message to a different channel

```php
$let[reportsChannel;$channelID[reports]]
$channelSendMessage[$reportsChannel;$mention has reported <@!$reportedUser>, for: $reason.
]
```

## 5. Confirmation message
So far, the command is sending a correct message to a different channel. Let's also send a message to the reporting user.
```php
$mention you report has been submitted, thank you for keeping our community safe.
```
