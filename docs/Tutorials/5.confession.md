# Simple Slash Command: Confession
In this guide, you will learn how to make a simple slash command called `/confess`, where user can use to send a confession in a beautiful embed like this:

## 1. Create a command
The first step is to create a new slash command:
* Head to your server in [dashboard](https://ccommandbot.com/dashboard)
* Click `Slash Command Builder`
* Construct the confess command (follow the next GIF)

## 2. Responding To Code
Next, Let's write the code that will respond when user runs the slash command:
* Head to your server in [dashboard](https://ccommandbot.com/dashboard)
* Click `Manage Your Commands`
* Click `Create`
* In Command Settings, select the Trigger Type to be "Slash Command", then select `/confess`
* For Code:
    * To respond to the user, you can do so with `$interactionReply[message]` where message is the text you would like to display:
    > For example: $interactionReply[Hello World]
    * To receive user input of confession, we can use $getOption[option name], where `option name` is same option name we used while building the slash command which is `message`
    > For example: $getOption[message]
    * So we would combine both and code would look like:
```php
$interactionReply[Your confession is

$getOption[message]
]
```

## 3. Output (Normal Message)
That is all, let's test it out :star_struck:

It works :happy:! but... what about making the respond into a beautiful embed?

## 4. Modify Code To Respond With Embed
To build an embed, we need to use [curl message format](../CodeReferences/ref.message_curl_format.md).
Curl is a way for you to build an embed in the place of the `message` input, for example to set up an embed with description and title we will use:
```js
{desc:My embed description}
{title:My embed title}
```
> You can see the full list [here](../CodeReferences/ref.message_curl_format.md)

So, We will modify the message content of `$interactionReply` and use the curl message format, code would look like:
```php
$interactionReply[

{title:$username's confession}
{desc:
$getOption[message]
}
{color:GREEN}
]
```

## 5. Output (Message With Embed)
Let's test again!

Congratulations, You made a functional slash command :tada:!
> Of course this might be simple, but it's good start!
