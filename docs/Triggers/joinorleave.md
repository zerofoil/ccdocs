## Syntax
Use this syntax to let the bot trigger when a member joined/left your guild/server

`add` -> If this is filled in in the trigger field, the command will trigger when a member joined your server!


`remove` -> If this is filled in in the trigger field, the command will trigger when a member left your server!

::: tip Testing
We understand that testing with this trigger can be quite difficult! For that reason, we made a command!

`!!emit uadd` to simulate that you joined your guild

`!!emit uremove` to simulate that you left your guild
